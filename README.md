# ReactPetFinderApp
This app uses mock API petfinder-client by Brian Holt to show and fetch animals that are up for adoption in USA. 
This app uses React 16, Parcel, Redux and Jest for testing.

To run this project you have to execute 'npm run start'. This will first build the app and then run it, 
because app uses ES6 modules it needs to be transpiled by babel in order to run in pure JS.
